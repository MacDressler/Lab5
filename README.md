This is my repo for ENGO551 Lab 5

I have finished alot of the coding, but I can't figure out the connection to the MQTT server. I have spent a few hours troubleshooting but I have run out of time now. My server would just connect and disconnect over and over, and I couldn't get any of the information to come through. Every once in a while it would work, but I spent so much time configuring MQTT servers, and I don't have time to do the last fix. I will still try and figure it out, but for this due date that won't be possible. 

Thank you,

Mac Dressler
